<!--The break element it is use to move text which are in the same line to the nest line  -->

<p>Hi <br> what are you up to</p> <p>So sorry i can make it am realy busy</p>

<!- In this example, the <br> tag is used to break the line. The text "Hi" and "what are you up to" will be on the same line, and when we hit enter, it will move to the next line. The "So sorry i can make it am realy busy" will be on the next line. ->
